# Morning brief — 2026-09-04

Final state, not the journey. **Four fixes shipped**, one customer question
answered with a "don't build this", and four decisions that are yours.

## THE ANSWER TO THE 10x QUESTION

Measured tonight, from Delta statistics alone:

**Our compaction MERGES but never SPLITS. That is sufficient until a group of
mutually-overlapping files outgrows a compaction bin — after which it is
permanently unmergeable and permanently overlapping. That is the frozen mass, and
it grows super-linearly with ingest volume.**

The overlap graph's connected components, over the 107 cells holding 17+ files:
**6,544 files form 206 components**; 71 % are under the 256 MiB target (median
9.8 MiB) and merge trivially, while **25 exceed 1 GiB and the largest is 89 GiB
across 328 files.** A component grows by chain-overlap — one file spanning two
windows welds them, and everything in either window then joins it — so **higher
ingest welds faster and pushes more components past the threshold.**

IOx's compactor merges *and* splits, which is why it can hold non-overlap as an
invariant at any scale. **The cheapest high-value change is a splitting
compaction for oversized components**: not a re-layout, just the ability to cut
one component into bin-sized time ranges. 71 % of components need nothing; 25
need this; and the 25 are where the bytes are.

Everything else below is either a fix that removed a blocker on the way to this,
or a measurement that led to it.

## The headline

**The customer-visible `hashes` timeout and the maintenance backlog are the same
defect, and the chain is now fully traced.** Every link was measured:

```
dedup lane starved
  -> bins stay dirty
  -> certification declines / probes starved
  -> cert_granted_total = 0
  -> sealed dates keep a STALE file-set fingerprint
  -> dedup_skipped = 0 of 2,051 eligible scans
  -> readmit_mutable_filters never fires
  -> the `hashes` predicate is stranded above DedupExec
  -> the issues page reads the whole window and times out
```

There is no separate read-path project to open. Draining the dedup lane fixes the
customer's queries **by the same mechanism**.

## Shipped and verified

| commit | what | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `875ea2a1` | Packer: the row cap must not reduce a bin to ONE file | **Prod cell merged.** `dcad860a/2026-06-17` went 4 files → 3; the 915,417 + 1,108,187 row pair became one file of **exactly 2,023,604 rows**. Livelocked for hours before. |
| `fa62883e` | Planner: check ROWS too, not just bytes | Its guard claimed to apply "the same test the packer applies" while checking one of two budgets. Test runs the **real packer** and asserts agreement. |
| `c627b356` | Dedup: certification probes were queued behind probes that cannot certify | Position is budget (one shared deadline). Test verified to fail on the old append ordering. |
| `eadc9def` | Rollup: the lane had **no liveness signal at all** | **VERIFIED IN PROD.** `work.BaseRollup.progress_rows` read **0 in every reading all night**; on the first process carrying this fix it reads **7,778,341**. Neither `note_unit_progress` nor `PlanProgress` was reachable from the lane before. |

**Two of the four now have direct, counter-independent confirmation:** `875ea2a1`
by the merged file in the Delta log, and `eadc9def` by `progress_rows` leaving 0.
`fa62883e` and `c627b356` remain unproven in prod — their effects are grants and
claim counts, which need the sustained uptime nobody had tonight.

Remember the caveat above: those 7.8 M rows are **plan `output_rows`**, i.e. rows
read and aggregated, not rows published. The number confirms the lane is now
*visible*; it is not an output measure.

Lane effect, `work.SealedConsolidation.worker_secs / uptime`: **4.0 % → 49.1 %**,
with 40.9 M `progress_rows`. Certification counters, comparable ~730 s uptimes,
before → after the first two fixes:

| reading | `875ea2a1` | `fa62883e` | `c627b356` |
|---|---|---|---|
| uptime at read | 703 s | 734 s | 842 s |
| `cert_granted_total` | 0 | 2 | **0** |
| `dedup_probe_timeouts_total` | 40 | 10 | **20** |
| `dedup_skipped` | 0 | 0 | **0** |

**RETRACTION — do not read the middle column as evidence.** An earlier version of
this brief reported `cert_granted_total` 0 → 2 and probe timeouts 40 → 10 as
directional confirmation. The next reading put them at 0 and 20. **These are
single-digit counts sampled from different processes with different queue states,
and they are noise, not signal.**

The reason is decision 2 below, and it is now quantified: the process restarts
observed while writing this were **13, 37 and 55 minutes ago** — lifetimes of
24, 18 and 14 minutes against maintenance units that run ~21 minutes.
**Certification grants and dedup skips are outcomes that require sustained
uptime, so in this environment they are not measurable at all.**

What survives that, because it does not depend on counters:

- The `875ea2a1` cell merge — a **file-level** fact from the Delta log: the pair
  became one file of exactly 2,023,604 rows.
- Every fix's **test**, each verified to fail on the pre-fix code.
- `dedup_skipped` has been **0 in every reading**, which is the honest bottom
  line: the customer-facing chain is **not yet unblocked**.

### One measurement caveat this creates

`eadc9def` gives the rollup lane liveness via `PlanProgress`, which feeds the
progress counter from **`output_rows` summed over every operator in the plan
tree**. The other lanes report through `note_unit_progress`, which counts rows
**written**. So `work.BaseRollup.progress_rows` will now read much LARGER than
the rows actually published — it is a liveness proxy, not an output count, and
**`progress_rows` now means different things on different lanes.** Do not compare
the two families against each other. (That inconsistency is itself a row in
`2026-09-04-lane-coverage-matrix.md`.)

## The pattern behind all four fixes

Every one is the same shape: **a mechanism that exists, is correct, and was
applied to some lanes but not the one that needed it most.**

| mechanism | fixed for | was missing from |
|---|---|---|
| shared capacity classifier | coordinator | hot-tail staging (`5dbd2b79`, earlier) |
| both packer budgets in the planner | bytes | rows (`fa62883e`) |
| fair position under a shared deadline | claim ordering (`dd4a557f`) | probe ordering (`c627b356`) |
| liveness watcher for blocking operators | repair, dedup (2026-09-01) | **rollups** (`eadc9def`) |

That is the generalisation worth acting on: not any single fix, but that the
codebase has no checklist saying a cross-cutting mechanism must cover every lane.
A coverage matrix is the cheap version of that checklist, and it is written up in
**`2026-09-04-lane-coverage-matrix.md`** — including the two lanes that still have
no "did nothing" signal at all, which is the recommended first task in daylight.

## THE CHAIN COMPLETED END TO END

At **2,726 s (45 min) uptime** — the longest-lived process of the night, and the
first to carry all four fixes for its whole life:

```
cert_granted_total   32      (0 in every reading before tonight's fixes)
dedup_skipped         1      <-- LEFT ZERO FOR THE FIRST TIME
dedup_eligible     5075
```

**`dedup_skipped` had been 0 in every single reading all night, and 0 is what the
whole customer-facing chain reduces to.** A query finally skipped `DedupExec`.

Read this for what it is and nothing more. **One skip in 5,075 eligible scans is
0.02 % — not a customer-visible improvement**, and I am not claiming the issues
page got faster. What it *is* is the first evidence that the chain can complete at
all: before tonight it was structurally impossible, because certification produced
zero grants, so no date could ever be skippable.

The sequence is now demonstrated end to end:

```
probes get fair position (c627b356)  ->  grants accrue (0 -> 32)
  ->  a date's files are proved (78)  ->  a scan skips the dedup (0 -> 1)
```

What remains between this and the customer's queries is **coverage arithmetic**,
not a broken mechanism: a query needs EVERY date it reads granted, and 32 grants
against 1,209 fleet cells is ~2.6 %. That is hours of uninterrupted uptime away —
which is exactly, and only, decision 2.

## The coverage arithmetic, now that a process lived 82 minutes

One process, sampled four times across its life — this is a within-lifetime
series, not a cross-process comparison:

| uptime | `cert_granted_total` | `cert_slice_files_proved` | `dedup_skipped` |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,828 s | 27 | 78 | 0 |
| 1,878 s | 29 | 78 | 0 |
| 2,726 s | 32 | 78 | **1** |
| **4,928 s** | **52** | **106** | 1 |

**Grants accumulate steadily at roughly 0.6/min and do not plateau.** That is the
mechanism working as designed, and it is the clearest single result of the night.

**But the queue is not converging.** Over the same window
`pending_dedup` went 2,169 → **2,223**, `pending_base_rollup` 257 → **337**,
`pending_sealed_consolidation` flat at ~230. **Arrivals still exceed throughput
even with all four fixes live and a process left alone for 82 minutes.**

That is the honest answer to the 10x question, and it is not a comfortable one:

- certification was **structurally dead** before tonight and is now **alive and
  accruing** — that part is fixed;
- but at ~0.6 grants/min against a fleet of **1,209 partition cells**, blanket
  coverage is **~32 hours of uninterrupted uptime**, and cells are re-dirtied by
  ingest far faster than that. Blanket coverage is therefore **not reachable by
  waiting**; it needs either a much higher grant rate or a cheaper proof.
- The cheaper proof is exactly what
  `2026-09-04-certification-proves-the-wrong-thing.md` argues for: certify
  **non-overlap from file statistics** rather than duplicate-freedom from a
  content scan. That is no longer a nice-to-have — the arithmetic above is the
  case for it.

`dedup_skipped` reaching 1 and staying there is consistent with all of this: a
query needs **every** date it reads granted, and scattered grants rarely complete
a window.

## The first readable process of the night

At 02:2x a process finally reached **1,828 s (30.5 min)** — the longest observed,
and the first carrying all four fixes. Against every earlier reading:

| | 703 s | 734 s | 842 s | **1,828 s** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cert_granted_total` | 0 | 2 | 0 | **27** |
| `dedup_probe_timeouts_total` | 40 | 10 | 20 | 49 |
| `work.BaseRollup.progress_rows` | 0 | 0 | 0 | **131,078,878** |
| `dedup_skipped` | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |

**27 grants is the first certification number meaningfully above noise.**
Normalised for uptime it is a ~5x higher grant rate than the 2 that I earlier
retracted — and unlike that reading, 27 is not a count two coin-flips could
produce. I would still call it *one* process rather than a trend, but it is the
first evidence that the certification path can produce grants at all when
something runs longer than half an hour.

**Confirmed WITHIN one process, which is the methodologically strong form.** Two
reads 50 s apart on the same process: `cert_granted_total` **27 → 29**, and
`cert_slice_files_proved` up to **78**. That is a delta inside a single lifetime,
not a comparison across processes, so it is immune to the noise that made me
retract the earlier 0 → 2. **Certification is actively granting, at roughly two
grants per minute.**

**`dedup_skipped` is nevertheless still 0**, and that remains the honest bottom
line. A query loses its `DedupExec` only when **every** date it reads is granted,
so 27 grants spread across projects and dates need not unblock a single query.
The customer-facing chain is **not yet closed.**

### Grants are produced; COVERAGE is the next wall

29 grants and 78 proved files, against **4,705 eligible scans with zero skips**
and a fleet of **1,209 partition cells** (the census in
`2026-09-04-lane-coverage-matrix.md`'s companion). That is roughly **2.4 % cell
coverage**, and the per-date skip requires **every** date a query reads to be
granted — so at 2.4 % essentially no real query window is fully covered.

This is a genuinely different state from where the night started. Then, the
question was "why does certification never grant?" — which turned out to be
starved probes and a starved dedup lane. Now grants are being produced steadily
and the question becomes **"how long until enough of them accumulate to cover a
query window?"** That is arithmetic on the grant rate against 1,209 cells, and it
is the first time that arithmetic has been possible.

It also re-points at decision 2: at ~2 grants/min, covering a meaningful fraction
of the fleet takes hours of **uninterrupted** uptime, and grants do not survive a
restart (`dedup_clean_fp` is process-local, persisted best-effort). A process
killed every 20 minutes can never accumulate coverage no matter how fast it
grants.

**The backlogs are still growing**, not shrinking: `pending_dedup` 2,185,
`pending_sealed_consolidation` 231, `pending_base_rollup` 257 — all above their
earlier values. Nothing tonight should be read as the queue converging.

## Maintenance capacity allocation is UNSTABLE, not misallocated

Two samples of `work.*.worker_secs` normalised to total maintenance work, from
two different processes an hour apart:

| lane | sample A (uptime 1,260 s) | sample B (uptime 992 s) |
|---|---:|---:|
| BaseRollup | 33.5 % | **62.5 %** |
| Dedup | **35.4 %** | 7.7 % |
| HotPacking | 15.1 % | 16.0 % |
| SealedConsolidation | 8.6 % | 8.0 % |
| Repair | 5.2 % | 4.7 % |
| DerivedRollup | 2.2 % | 1.1 % |

The two big lanes **swap places completely** — Dedup goes from the largest
consumer to 7.7 %, BaseRollup from a third to nearly two thirds — while the four
smaller lanes stay within a point or two.

**The tempting read is "BaseRollup is hogging capacity and starving dedup". I do
not think that is supported.** What the pair actually shows is that with ~20-minute
process lifetimes, **which lane dominates is decided by whatever the coordinator
claims first after a cold start**, and a long unit that begins early holds its
share for the rest of the (short) process. Allocation is therefore close to
arbitrary from one restart to the next.

That matters for the goal in a specific way: **no lane can currently be shown to
be starved, and none can be shown to be greedy** — so any scheduling change made
now would be tuned against noise. It is a third independent line of evidence for
decision 2, and it is the reason I stopped shipping scheduling changes tonight.

If sample B's split were the steady state, it alone would explain the entire
customer chain: dedup at 7.7 % of capacity cannot clear a 2,152-unit backlog, so
bins stay dirty, certification never grants, and the `hashes` predicate stays
stranded. Establishing whether it IS the steady state needs exactly one thing —
a process that lives for a few hours.

## The customer question, answered — and the answer is "don't build it"

`hashes @> ARRAY['err:…']` on issues pages. Selectivity is superb (**0.03 %–0.54 %**
of rows), so pushing the predicate below the dedup would be worth a great deal.
**I did not build it, because the data says it is unsafe.**

Auditing a full prod partition-day (201 live files, 1.86 M rows, 25,011
multi-version keys): **1 version pair in 25,014 replaces its tag outright**
(`['e583c276']` → `['f0131962']`, three hours apart). Reading monoscope's three
current writers said "append-only, ship it". The data disagreed. Pushed down, a
query for the retired tag would return a **ghost row presented as current** on the
page a customer uses to decide what is broken.

Note the dashboards are the opposite shape: the top *endpoint* hash matches **90 %**
of rows, so those panels never stood to gain. Don't quote one "hashes" number.

## A wall-clock-dependent test failure on master (not from tonight's fixes)

`dedup_compaction_test::a_chart_under_a_derived_table_routes_and_agrees_with_raw`
fails on master right now. **It is not a regression from tonight's four fixes:**
it fails identically at `c627b356`, and that same commit ran the entire suite
green (1355/1355) about two hours earlier. Same code, different answer.

The miss reason it prints is **`tiny_interior=1`** — a rollup-routing refusal
that depends on where `now()` falls relative to bucket boundaries. So the test is
**wall-clock dependent**: it will fail CI at some times of day and pass at
others. It uses real time where this repo has a virtual clock (`crate::support`)
built precisely for this.

Worth fixing on its own merits, and worth knowing before anyone reads a red CI
run tonight as evidence against the four fixes.

## A branch is ready for review: `prep/otel-metrics-collapse`

Pushed as a branch, deliberately **not** master, so it does not deploy
(`deploy.yml` triggers on master only). It contains the `otel_metrics`
conversion described in `2026-09-04-otel-metrics-never-got-the-collapse.md`:

- `dedup_keys` widened to the sort prefix — the same change logs got on
  2026-09-02, which this table never received;
- `FORMAT_VERSION` 2 → 3, which `read/mod.rs:2823` already documents as the only
  coupling a widening needs (the sort order and every existing footer are
  untouched, because `sorting_columns` does not change);
- `every_merge_on_read_table_can_take_the_streaming_collapse`, a guard verified
  to fail on the un-widened schema.

Its correctness precondition is measured, not assumed: **22,773,893 rows across
186 files and all three heavy tenants, identical key cardinality every time.**
Full lib suite green (1133).

## Decisions that are yours

1. **The monoscope `hashes` append-only contract.** If tags are *meant* to be
   append-only, that one replacement is a client bug worth finding — most likely
   the endpoint remapping in `Endpoints.hs:544`, or a re-ingest with a recomputed
   hash. If remapping is intended, the pushdown is permanently unavailable and
   the long-term safe route is a tantivy index on `hashes` (sound with no client
   invariant, but it rebuilds every index on the table at ~16/hour).
2. **The other session's deploy cadence — the biggest environmental blocker.**
   Prod was redeployed every **25–30 minutes** all night (`DesiredState=Shutdown`,
   no error). Maintenance units run ~21 minutes, so most die to process exit.
   **No throughput number measured tonight is valid**, and no convergence can
   happen at this cadence. Only you can coordinate this, and against the 10x goal
   it matters more than any single fix in the table above.
   **My own honest share of this:** I pushed four src changes tonight, and each
   push *is* a deploy that killed the running process and whatever units were
   in flight. So I contributed four of the night's restarts while naming the
   cadence as the top blocker. The distinction I would still defend is that a
   fix that lands is worth a restart and a repeated no-op redeploy is not — but
   the measurement damage is the same either way, and the honest reading is that
   **nobody could have measured convergence tonight, including me.**
3. **Debt-metric semantics.** `sealed_compaction_debt_bytes` (1.33 TB) counts
   **35.9 GiB** sitting in 49 cells that are provably unworkable — their two
   smallest files cannot pair within the byte budget. It misleads no scheduler,
   but it is the number a human reads to judge whether compaction is keeping up.
   I wrote it up rather than changing it.
4. **Whether to pursue the certification redesign** in
   `2026-09-04-certification-proves-the-wrong-thing.md` — see below.

## The one structural idea worth your attention

Prior art says **we are certifying the wrong property**. IOx does not certify "I
removed the duplicates"; it maintains **non-overlap** as a structural invariant,
records it per file as a compaction level, and the querier unions non-overlapping
files above the dedup, merging only the overlapping ones.

- Ours is **per-partition** (a file-list fingerprint), so one new file voids it
  for every file. Theirs is **per-file**, so it survives ingest.
- Ours is minted by a **later probe**. Theirs by the **compactor at commit**.
- Ours asserts a **content** property needing a scan. Theirs asserts a
  **structural** one checkable from min/max statistics alone.

**Non-overlap in the dedup-key space *implies* duplicate-freedom** — two versions
of one key are the same key, so key-disjoint files cannot hold a duplicate group
between them. A statistics-only check subsumes the expensive scan. The soundness
argument is already written and reviewed in `read::skippable_certified_files`;
what would change is where the evidence comes from — and statistics survive
restarts, deploys and new writes, which a process-local `dedup_clean_fp` does not.

I deliberately did **not** relax certification to grant after a dedup rewrite,
even though the output is clean by construction: IOx never certifies "I did the
work correctly", and trusting the rewrite would make a dedup bug invisible rather
than merely expensive. The failure mode is a silent over-count on every dashboard
tile.

## Corrections I published against myself

Recorded because the reasoning is the useful part:

- **"Maintenance voids the proof it earns"** → **retracted**. Sealed dates in the
  2–7d band received **zero** file-set changes in 4.2 hours, so there is no churn
  to race. The proof is *stale and never re-issued*, not repeatedly destroyed.
  A never-refreshed proof and a constantly-invalidated one produce the **identical**
  `fp_moved` counter; only the Delta log could tell them apart.
- **"The unpairable byte band is wrong"** → **over-corrected**. The fleet census
  (all 1,209 cells) found 49 byte-blocked cells = **29.2 %** of cells with ≥2
  under-target files — the same 29 % originally measured. Both classes are real
  and disjoint: 49 byte-blocked, 8 row-blocked. My error was generalising a
  correct measurement to a cell that failed for a different reason.

## Where I would go next

1. Re-read the lane and certification counters on an **aged, quiet** process —
   the one thing that converts tonight's directional numbers into steady-state
   ones. Blocked on decision 2.
2. Confirm `c627b356` deploys and watch `cert_granted_total` and
   `dedup_probe_timeouts_total`; the acceptance test is `dedup_skipped` finally
   leaving 0.
3. Only then, the certification redesign — it is a real design change and should
   not start until the cheap fixes are proven to have run out.
