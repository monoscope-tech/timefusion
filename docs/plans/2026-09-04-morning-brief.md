# Morning brief — 2026-09-04

Final state, not the journey. **Four fixes shipped**, one customer question
answered with a "don't build this", and four decisions that are yours.

## The headline

**The customer-visible `hashes` timeout and the maintenance backlog are the same
defect, and the chain is now fully traced.** Every link was measured:

```
dedup lane starved
  -> bins stay dirty
  -> certification declines / probes starved
  -> cert_granted_total = 0
  -> sealed dates keep a STALE file-set fingerprint
  -> dedup_skipped = 0 of 2,051 eligible scans
  -> readmit_mutable_filters never fires
  -> the `hashes` predicate is stranded above DedupExec
  -> the issues page reads the whole window and times out
```

There is no separate read-path project to open. Draining the dedup lane fixes the
customer's queries **by the same mechanism**.

## Shipped and verified

| commit | what | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `875ea2a1` | Packer: the row cap must not reduce a bin to ONE file | **Prod cell merged.** `dcad860a/2026-06-17` went 4 files → 3; the 915,417 + 1,108,187 row pair became one file of **exactly 2,023,604 rows**. Livelocked for hours before. |
| `fa62883e` | Planner: check ROWS too, not just bytes | Its guard claimed to apply "the same test the packer applies" while checking one of two budgets. Test runs the **real packer** and asserts agreement. |
| `c627b356` | Dedup: certification probes were queued behind probes that cannot certify | Position is budget (one shared deadline). Test verified to fail on the old append ordering. |
| `eadc9def` | Rollup: the lane had **no liveness signal at all** | Neither `note_unit_progress` nor `PlanProgress` was reachable from it, so the clock read zero for the whole unit. Source-level guard, verified to fail unwatched. |

`c627b356` and `eadc9def` were still deploying at the time of writing; their
acceptance checks are listed under "Where I would go next".

Lane effect, `work.SealedConsolidation.worker_secs / uptime`: **4.0 % → 49.1 %**,
with 40.9 M `progress_rows`. Certification counters, comparable ~730 s uptimes,
before → after the first two fixes:

| reading | `875ea2a1` | `fa62883e` | `c627b356` |
|---|---|---|---|
| uptime at read | 703 s | 734 s | 842 s |
| `cert_granted_total` | 0 | 2 | **0** |
| `dedup_probe_timeouts_total` | 40 | 10 | **20** |
| `dedup_skipped` | 0 | 0 | **0** |

**RETRACTION — do not read the middle column as evidence.** An earlier version of
this brief reported `cert_granted_total` 0 → 2 and probe timeouts 40 → 10 as
directional confirmation. The next reading put them at 0 and 20. **These are
single-digit counts sampled from different processes with different queue states,
and they are noise, not signal.**

The reason is decision 2 below, and it is now quantified: the process restarts
observed while writing this were **13, 37 and 55 minutes ago** — lifetimes of
24, 18 and 14 minutes against maintenance units that run ~21 minutes.
**Certification grants and dedup skips are outcomes that require sustained
uptime, so in this environment they are not measurable at all.**

What survives that, because it does not depend on counters:

- The `875ea2a1` cell merge — a **file-level** fact from the Delta log: the pair
  became one file of exactly 2,023,604 rows.
- Every fix's **test**, each verified to fail on the pre-fix code.
- `dedup_skipped` has been **0 in every reading**, which is the honest bottom
  line: the customer-facing chain is **not yet unblocked**.

### One measurement caveat this creates

`eadc9def` gives the rollup lane liveness via `PlanProgress`, which feeds the
progress counter from **`output_rows` summed over every operator in the plan
tree**. The other lanes report through `note_unit_progress`, which counts rows
**written**. So `work.BaseRollup.progress_rows` will now read much LARGER than
the rows actually published — it is a liveness proxy, not an output count, and
**`progress_rows` now means different things on different lanes.** Do not compare
the two families against each other. (That inconsistency is itself a row in
`2026-09-04-lane-coverage-matrix.md`.)

## The pattern behind all four fixes

Every one is the same shape: **a mechanism that exists, is correct, and was
applied to some lanes but not the one that needed it most.**

| mechanism | fixed for | was missing from |
|---|---|---|
| shared capacity classifier | coordinator | hot-tail staging (`5dbd2b79`, earlier) |
| both packer budgets in the planner | bytes | rows (`fa62883e`) |
| fair position under a shared deadline | claim ordering (`dd4a557f`) | probe ordering (`c627b356`) |
| liveness watcher for blocking operators | repair, dedup (2026-09-01) | **rollups** (`eadc9def`) |

That is the generalisation worth acting on: not any single fix, but that the
codebase has no checklist saying a cross-cutting mechanism must cover every lane.
A coverage matrix is the cheap version of that checklist, and it is written up in
**`2026-09-04-lane-coverage-matrix.md`** — including the two lanes that still have
no "did nothing" signal at all, which is the recommended first task in daylight.

## The customer question, answered — and the answer is "don't build it"

`hashes @> ARRAY['err:…']` on issues pages. Selectivity is superb (**0.03 %–0.54 %**
of rows), so pushing the predicate below the dedup would be worth a great deal.
**I did not build it, because the data says it is unsafe.**

Auditing a full prod partition-day (201 live files, 1.86 M rows, 25,011
multi-version keys): **1 version pair in 25,014 replaces its tag outright**
(`['e583c276']` → `['f0131962']`, three hours apart). Reading monoscope's three
current writers said "append-only, ship it". The data disagreed. Pushed down, a
query for the retired tag would return a **ghost row presented as current** on the
page a customer uses to decide what is broken.

Note the dashboards are the opposite shape: the top *endpoint* hash matches **90 %**
of rows, so those panels never stood to gain. Don't quote one "hashes" number.

## Decisions that are yours

1. **The monoscope `hashes` append-only contract.** If tags are *meant* to be
   append-only, that one replacement is a client bug worth finding — most likely
   the endpoint remapping in `Endpoints.hs:544`, or a re-ingest with a recomputed
   hash. If remapping is intended, the pushdown is permanently unavailable and
   the long-term safe route is a tantivy index on `hashes` (sound with no client
   invariant, but it rebuilds every index on the table at ~16/hour).
2. **The other session's deploy cadence — the biggest environmental blocker.**
   Prod was redeployed every **25–30 minutes** all night (`DesiredState=Shutdown`,
   no error). Maintenance units run ~21 minutes, so most die to process exit.
   **No throughput number measured tonight is valid**, and no convergence can
   happen at this cadence. Only you can coordinate this, and against the 10x goal
   it matters more than any single fix in the table above.
3. **Debt-metric semantics.** `sealed_compaction_debt_bytes` (1.33 TB) counts
   **35.9 GiB** sitting in 49 cells that are provably unworkable — their two
   smallest files cannot pair within the byte budget. It misleads no scheduler,
   but it is the number a human reads to judge whether compaction is keeping up.
   I wrote it up rather than changing it.
4. **Whether to pursue the certification redesign** in
   `2026-09-04-certification-proves-the-wrong-thing.md` — see below.

## The one structural idea worth your attention

Prior art says **we are certifying the wrong property**. IOx does not certify "I
removed the duplicates"; it maintains **non-overlap** as a structural invariant,
records it per file as a compaction level, and the querier unions non-overlapping
files above the dedup, merging only the overlapping ones.

- Ours is **per-partition** (a file-list fingerprint), so one new file voids it
  for every file. Theirs is **per-file**, so it survives ingest.
- Ours is minted by a **later probe**. Theirs by the **compactor at commit**.
- Ours asserts a **content** property needing a scan. Theirs asserts a
  **structural** one checkable from min/max statistics alone.

**Non-overlap in the dedup-key space *implies* duplicate-freedom** — two versions
of one key are the same key, so key-disjoint files cannot hold a duplicate group
between them. A statistics-only check subsumes the expensive scan. The soundness
argument is already written and reviewed in `read::skippable_certified_files`;
what would change is where the evidence comes from — and statistics survive
restarts, deploys and new writes, which a process-local `dedup_clean_fp` does not.

I deliberately did **not** relax certification to grant after a dedup rewrite,
even though the output is clean by construction: IOx never certifies "I did the
work correctly", and trusting the rewrite would make a dedup bug invisible rather
than merely expensive. The failure mode is a silent over-count on every dashboard
tile.

## Corrections I published against myself

Recorded because the reasoning is the useful part:

- **"Maintenance voids the proof it earns"** → **retracted**. Sealed dates in the
  2–7d band received **zero** file-set changes in 4.2 hours, so there is no churn
  to race. The proof is *stale and never re-issued*, not repeatedly destroyed.
  A never-refreshed proof and a constantly-invalidated one produce the **identical**
  `fp_moved` counter; only the Delta log could tell them apart.
- **"The unpairable byte band is wrong"** → **over-corrected**. The fleet census
  (all 1,209 cells) found 49 byte-blocked cells = **29.2 %** of cells with ≥2
  under-target files — the same 29 % originally measured. Both classes are real
  and disjoint: 49 byte-blocked, 8 row-blocked. My error was generalising a
  correct measurement to a cell that failed for a different reason.

## Where I would go next

1. Re-read the lane and certification counters on an **aged, quiet** process —
   the one thing that converts tonight's directional numbers into steady-state
   ones. Blocked on decision 2.
2. Confirm `c627b356` deploys and watch `cert_granted_total` and
   `dedup_probe_timeouts_total`; the acceptance test is `dedup_skipped` finally
   leaving 0.
3. Only then, the certification redesign — it is a real design change and should
   not start until the cheap fixes are proven to have run out.
